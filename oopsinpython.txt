Hi,

Ambrish here,

We are learning OOPS in Python from Jenny.

1)Every object is an instance of a class.
2)A class is a blueprint to create object..
e.g., class=instructor , object=Jenny,Raghav

OBJECT has:
     i)variables/attributes
     ii)methods/functions

e.g. Idly maker can facilitate making of Idly's.
e.g. Sktech of a house is class and house is an object of that class.

#CLASS can be  user defined as well as inbuilt also.

-->Classname should be in PascalCase...

SYNTAX:e.g.,
      class Instructor:
       #statements

  instructor_1=Instructor() // object
